#DP Project Descriptions:

### 1. Course Allocator System:
Description:
The project aims to develop a Course Allocator system that assigns courses to students based on their preferences. It involves several classes and files, including `Main.java`, `CourseInfo.java`, `StudentInfo.java`, `FileProcessor.java`, `InputRead.java`, and `ResultWrite.java`. The program reads data from `courseInfo.txt` and `coursePrefs.txt`, assigns courses to students using the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) approach while considering capacity and schedule restrictions, and writes the output to a text file. However, the solution lacks the implementation of the satisfaction score.

### 2. Backup System for Student Record:
Description:
The project focuses on implementing a Backup System for Student Record using design principles. It involves several classes and files, including `Driver.java`, `BST.java`, `Node.java`, `SubjectInterface.java`, `ObserverInterface.java`, and `FileProcessor.java`. The system utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure to store student records and applies the Observer Pattern to establish one-to-many relationships between the main tree and backup trees. The output includes the Inorder traversal, sum, and sum after increment for the main Tree, backup-1, and backup-2 trees.

### 3. Campus Tours at Binghamton University:
Description:
This project involves the development of a program for Campus Tours at Binghamton University. The solution uses an ArrayList data structure to store the cost, time, CO2 emissions, and efforts associated with each activity. The design incorporates the Builder Pattern to control the creation of complex objects at runtime. Sample output is generated based on specific choices, displaying the total cost, duration, carbon footprints, and efforts for each Campus Tour.

### 4. Finding K Most Frequent Words:
Description:
The project focuses on finding the K most frequent words using a HashMap data structure. The implementation utilizes HashMap for storing key-value pairs and an iterator to efficiently iterate through the data structure. The design incorporates Programming to an Interface, Visitor Pattern, and Strategy Pattern. Sample outputs are generated based on specific choices, demonstrating the most frequent words and different strategies for handling case sensitivity.
